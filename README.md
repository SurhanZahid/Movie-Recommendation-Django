### Description
In this project, I wanted to implement different recommendation techniques on the Django framework to see how can I perform these algorithms on this framework.

### Knowledge Based Recommendation
Knowledge-based recommender systems are a specific type of recommender system that are based on explicit knowledge about the item assortment, user preferences, and recommendation criteria.


### Tech

Movie Recommendation uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [numpy] - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
* [pandas] - Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
* [pymysql] - This package contains a pure-Python MySQL client library, based on PEP 249.
* [mysql] - MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.
* [python] - Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language

And of course Photo Gallery itself is open source .
